## Understanding How React Works Across Platforms

React is the core library used to build user interfaces, and it's the same whether you're building for the web, mobile, or even VR. Tools like React Native, React Three Fiber, and React 360 all use the same React at their core. What changes is the rendering layerâ€”on the web, that's handled by React DOM, which takes care of updating the browser.
